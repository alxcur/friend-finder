### Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. This app uses Express to handle routing and is also deployed to Heroku.
